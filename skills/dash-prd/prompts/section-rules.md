# Section Rules — Dash PRD

These rules are used during validation (Mode 2) and inline checking during generation (Mode 1).
A violation blocks progression to the next section. Warnings are noted but do not block.

---

## Dash-Specific Guardrails (apply across sections)

- **Tribe + BU + User Surface fields are MANDATORY in §2 frontmatter. Do not skip.** Missing any of these is a §2 violation. If unknown, write `[TBD — confirm with tribe lead]` — never omit.
- **User-facing copy in mitra-facing surfaces (mobile app, mitra-facing screens) MUST use formal "Anda"** per Dash voice rule. Any "kamu", "yaa", "lewatin", "bakal", "udah", or other casual register in §8 user stories or §9 solution prose is a §8 / §9 violation.
- **Indonesian regulation citations (OJK / UU PDP / BI / Kominfo) must use the specific regulation number** (e.g., `OJK POJK 12/2018`, not just `OJK`). Generic "OJK regulations" is a §3 / §13 violation.

---

## §1 — Initiative Name

**VIOLATIONS (block):**
- Name exceeds 8 words
- Name is a verb phrase (e.g., "Add Dark Mode") instead of a noun phrase

**WARNINGS (flag but don't block):**
- Name contains an internal codename or acronym that external stakeholders may not recognise
- Name does not match what's in Jira, Confluence, or roadmap (ask user to confirm)

- **BU field is missing or not a valid enum value** (must be one of QUICK_COMMERCE / EXPRESS / X_DOCK / SCHEDULED_INSTANT / CANVASSER_RENTAL / 4_WHEEL / OUTSOURCING / STAGING)
- **User Surface field is missing** (must specify Halo-Dash / Portal-v2 / Basecamp / Mitra mobile / React-Fleet or `[TBD]`)
